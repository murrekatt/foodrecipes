### Ulf's Best Chocolate Cake

![Dish](dish.jpg)

Childhood memories.

#### Ingredients

8 persons.

+ 110 g butter
+ 2 eggs
+ 3 dl sugar
+ 1.5 dl wheat flour
+ 4 tbsp cacao powder
+ 1.5 tbsp vanilla sugar

#### Preparation

45 minutes.

1. Heat the oven to 150 degrees.
2. Whip the eggs and sugar until white and fluffy. This is rather hard work and requires some stamina if done by hand.
3. Melt the butter. Add together with the whipped eggs and sugar.
4. Mix the rest of the ingredients.
5. Pour into the buttered form. The recommended form is a round one with sides you can remove, so all what is left is a plate for the cake.
6. Bake the cake in the oven for around 30 minutes. The cake should have a crusty top while inside it's softer, but still not unbaked.
