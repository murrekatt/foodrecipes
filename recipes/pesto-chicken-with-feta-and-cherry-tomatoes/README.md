# Pesto Chicken with Feta and Cherry Tomatoes

![Dish](dish.jpg)

One of my absolute favorite recipes I have from my parents. This is a true winner.

## Ingredients

4 persons.

2 chicken breasts
150 g feta cheese
100 g black olives
1 red onion
pesto
cherry tomatoes
salt
black pepper
300 g Fusilli pasta

## Preparation

30 minutes.

1. Boil water for the pasta. Salt. When the water starts boiling, add the pasta and follow instructions on the package.
2. Cut the chicken breast into 3 cm pieces.
3. Heat a frying-pan and fry the chicken meat. Stir while frying until the meat has got a nice color. Salt and pepper slightly.
4. Cut the red onion into half rings. Add into the pan with the chicken.
5. Mix the pesto with the fried chicken.
6. Add the olives into the pan.
7. Wash and cut the cherry tomatoes into halves. Add into the pan as well.
8. Cut the feta cheese into cubes. Add into the pan.
9. When the pasta is ready, mix with sauce. When pouring away the water the pasta has boiled in, leave 1 dl to have liquid with the pasta. Take a serving bowl and mix the pasta and the sauce.

The ingredients in the sauce should not be overcooked, rather slightly soft on the direction of 'al dente'. Serve immediately when warm.
