# Laugen Gipfeli with Tuna Filling

![Dish](dish.jpg)

This is just delicious! Simple and tastes great. It's based on something similar I ate several times a cafe in Oberdorf in Baar.

## Ingredients

+ 4 Silser gipfelis
+ 1 can Tuna
+ 1 bunch grass onion
+ 5 tbsp mayo
+ black pepper
+ lemon juice

## Preparation

Collect all ingredients before you start, because this goes fast when you get started.

1. Open the tuna can and put the contents into a bowl. You can use either tuna in oil or water. I almost prefer to have white tuna in oil, because this tastes the best.
2. Add the mayo.
3. Wash and chop the grass onion into fine pieces.
4. Add the grass onion together with the tuna into the bowl.
5. Mix the ingredients in the bowl.
6. Add lemon juice and black pepper according to own taste.
7. Cut the gipfelis in halfs so you end up with a top and a bottom piece.
8. Fill the gipfelis with the tuna mixture.
